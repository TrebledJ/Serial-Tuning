# Serial Tuning

## Features

* [x] Tune variables without restarting the program, using Arduino's serial monitor (`Serial`).
* [x] Tune a plethora of types: integers, floating-points, strings.
* [x] Works on boards based on the Arduino framework (e.g. ESP32).

## Roadmap

* [ ] Print variables.
* [ ] Work with other UART pins, not just the default `Serial`.
